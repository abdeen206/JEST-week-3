# **H.W 3**
In this H.W  we will build a small Python program to manage a record store., you'll find here a DB named chinook.db and a DB diagram. The program will work with a text-based interface that you’ll write,and will let the user to write and read information to and from the database.

### Tools:

The user interface will be text based. Divide the functionalities into a menu and submenus in order to find a tool easily.
Make sure that you can get back to the main menu from each sub menu.
Make sure that every tool guides the user on how to enter the relevant data.
Write the user interface in a generic fashion. Make sure that new functionalities can be added easily, and don’t repeat yourself in your code.
